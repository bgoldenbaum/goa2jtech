1. Button Labels:
Issue: Magnifying glass icons (Zoom in/out) and the full-screen button are read as “clickable” without indicating their function.
Fix: Add aria-label or title attributes.
<button aria-label="Zoom in button">...</button>
<button aria-label="Zoom out button">...</button>

2. Heading Structure:
Issue: "Test" heading reads as Heading Level 3 instead of Heading Level 1.
Fix: Use <h1> for "Test" and <h2> for "Title."
<h1>Test</h1>
<h2>Title</h2>

3. Required Fields:

Issue: Asterisks are read as "star" without indicating the field is required.
Fix: Use aria-required="true" and add descriptive text.
<label for="field1">Name <span aria-hidden="true">*</span></label>
<input id="field1" aria-required="true" aria-describedby="required-desc"> 
<span id="required-desc" class="sr-only">This field is required.</span>

4. Error Messages:
Issue: "Field is required" message is not read aloud.
Fix: Implement ARIA live regions and adjust focus.
<div aria-live="polite">Field is required</div>

5. Calendar Widget:
Issue: Link address is read aloud before calendar instructions.
Fix: Ensure the instructions are announced first by adjusting focus or ARIA attributes.

6. "Add More" Button:
Issue: The button is not descriptive enough.
Fix: Rename and reposition for clarity.
<button aria-label="Add another email address">Add More</button>

7. Radio Buttons:
Issue: "Primary" toggle switch is skipped over.
Fix: Use the role="switch" attribute to identify the element as a toggle switch for screen readers.
Ensure that the toggle switch has an appropriate aria-checked attribute to indicate its current state (either true or false).
Provide a clear aria-label to describe the switch's function.

8. Close ("X") Button:
Issue: The “X” close button is skipped over.
Fix: Add aria-label for screen reader recognition.
<button aria-label="Close modal">X</button>

9. "Type" Label and Input:
Issue: The label "Type" and placeholder "Type here" are confusing.
Fix: Change the label to something more descriptive.
<label for="category">Category</label>
<input id="category" placeholder="Enter category">

10. Form Field Question:
Issue: “Originated in Clio?” does not sound like a question.
Fix: Rephrase it to a full sentence or explicit question "Did this originate in Clio?"

11. Accessibility Widget:
Issue: The widget is read as “Clickable” without indicating its function, and NVDA doesn't recognize it as a modal.
Fix:
Add aria-label for clarity.
<button aria-label="Accessibility options">Accessibility Widget</button>
Ensure modal is properly coded with role="dialog" and aria-modal="true".
